      Moira, Mama Miriam and Adam are totally at ease in their individual squats. These squats - their bespoke homes - are in city centre alcoves, alleyways or other derelict places; they are public, yet hidden and protectedâ€¦ Paradise has three acts, nine scenes, three characters - each of whom is a relic in some way. The characters don't interact with one another, rather, they mostly have 'dialogues' with objects or absent or silent people. In part, Paradise is a response to reality TV; the play has been likened to Black Mirror. This playscript offers opportunities for creative collaborations between live theatre, film and virtual production.</p>

    <h5>No Name</h5>

    <p>
      No Name is loosely based on a news story of a young woman, a freedom fighter from Kurdistan. The main character's journey through life - and love - towards death takes us, feelingly, into the violent clashes between contemporary nation states and peoples subsumed unwillingly within these. In 2023, it is strongly resonant of horrific current events in Ukraine and Iran. Scenes from the play were performed in April 2023 and July 2023 in the Cardiff Atrium Studio Theatre. The full play was performed in September 2023, as part of a pilot for a renewed Cardiff Fringe Festival.

    <h5>Hoodoo</h5>
    <p>  <small>a new standup play by GJ Kalic</small></p>

    <p>
      Hoodoo is an audacious stand-up / theatrical cartoon. A 'Rabelaisian' piece of satire inspired by the new Sultan Erdogan - which does not ever name him - the play can readily apply to many of the illiberal political figures currently in the ascendent. This cartoon taking the piss out of the illiberal is timely and needed.
