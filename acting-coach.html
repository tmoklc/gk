    His contribution to the pedagogy and thereby the reputation of the renowned East 15 Acting School was significant. He built upon and articulated then Director Maggie Bury’s take on the Littlewood/Theatre Workshop approach by adding European technique and rigour to the training mix, enabling the creation of a distinctive, technically accomplished and influential house style of acting. He initiated the School’s founder-member status within the National Council of Drama Schools (where he served as E15’s representative). He also contributed to the School’s international profile through the generation of links with prominent European theatre schools and companies.
